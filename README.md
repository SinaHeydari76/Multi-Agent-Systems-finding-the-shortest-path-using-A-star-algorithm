# Introuction
As mortal creatures, we tend to escape the reality of death hiding behind mental
structures we build. It’s not strange that the lines have escaped our minds and came to reality
taking shapes into structures we build to overcome chaos although, many has always argued
the absurd nature of order in human hands.

To begin with, organizing transportation has always been interesting to human mind. In this
project I tried to visualize the very simple and basic features of a transportation system like
Uber using A-star algorithm.

## A-star
#### What is A* Search Algorithm?
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph
traversals. Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”.
What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other
conventional algorithms. This fact is cleared in detail in below sections.
And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to
find the shortest path very efficiently (approximation).
